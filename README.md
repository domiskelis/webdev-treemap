# fcc: d3 Treemap

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Dominic-Mikelis/pen/zYJKdmb](https://codepen.io/Dominic-Mikelis/pen/zYJKdmb).

Live demo shows code compiled through Codepen's export; code as I edited it can be reviewed in the codepen-src folder.

A webpage that renders one of three datasets provided by FCC; works by combining:
    Two global data-fetching and -graphing functions for D3 utility;
    A set of objects which define dataset info and source,  as well as button names and display icons;
    and a React component which handles the interactivity of the page, i.e. responding to button clicks and mouse hover.

The FCC task only asked for a plot of one dataset, but this page passes tests for all three and allows seamlessly switching between different graphs, as well as randomising the legend colours.
